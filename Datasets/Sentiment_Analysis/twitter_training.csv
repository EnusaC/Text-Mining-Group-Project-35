2416,Borderlands,NEU,I hate that this easy mayhem modifier event on mayhem won’t last forever. this is the most fun i’ve had in the game since they added them horrible modifiers. @Borderlands please give me the option to play mayhem 10 but turn the modifiers off PLS
2417,Borderlands,NEG,Grounded almost looked pretty cool even despite the borderlands tier unfunny writing until it became yet another survival crafting game. I really can’t wait for this shitty trend to die

1944,CallOfDutyBlackopsColdWar,NEG,@Treyarch any possibility of updating blackout to be cross platform? It doesn’t even have to be on the new game. I think it would be a great idea for people not into warzone. A ton of bigger streamers also prefer it.
